# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The raw data was given from Kickstarter; a website that exists to aid in the creation of projects, whether it's a film, play, music, art etc. The data included numerous individual projects with varying subcategories alongside their results, funding and important dates for those projects.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to organize the data and present it neatly, showcasing the outcomes of specific projects based on their launch date and monetary goals in order to make deductions such as what time of the year is best to release a specific type of project. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Personally, the process of analyzing the raw data was pretty challenging as it was my very first time doing so on Excel. Since everything was new to me, for every difficulty encountered I took extra time to learn it separately while asking my peers. My biggest challenge was changing the 10 digit serial numbers into dates as it was more common to change 8 digit serial numbers rather than 10 so I was stuck for a while, I overcame this specific issue by doing my own separate research on how to manipulate Excel. Coming to conclusions once the data was separated and reorganized to specific sections numerous times, was the easiest part in my opinion. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the table and graph on deliverable 1, it can be concluded that a project has a higher probability of succeeding when launched during the late spring/early summer as the months of May and June have the highest success rate. Furthermore, it can be concluded that December is the worst month to have a launch date on as it’s the month with the smallest ratio of successful to failed projects. Therefore, most families prefer to stay at home together during the holidays since, the data was filtered to the subcategory of “theatre”. Some limitations to this are that since the table and graph was filtered to only consider “theatre” projects, so there’s the possibility that the optimal success time to launch is different per type of project. Furthermore, the same thing applies for each individual country, the successful launch date could vary. Another limitation could be the disregard of historical context, what happened during each specific year and could it have affected the outcome?
### Analysis of Outocmes Based on Goals

Based on the table and graph on deliverable 2, it can be seen that the plays with low monetary goals tend to have a higher success percentage out of the plays with similar monetary goals. Furthermore, as the goals begin to get higher and higher, the percentage of successful plays decreases as the percentage of failed plays increases up until both hitting 50% each and then the percentage of failed shot up as the percentage of successful shot down. The general trend to outcomes based on goals is that as goals get higher, the percentage of successful plays tend to generally decrease with huge fluctuations and vise-versa for the percentage of failed plays. Thus, based on the percentages displayed on the graph, the plays that are most likely to succeed are those with monetary goals of less than 1000. Some limitations to this are that the results are only displaying for the subcategory of plays meaning, that results will vary when changing the subcategory we’re looking at. Furthermore, the second deliverable only has the requirements of which monetary goal the play had, and whether it was successful, failed or canceled completely disregarding the quality of the play and how successful or how much of a failure the play was. In addition, this set of results doesn’t include the plays that are currently live; understandably so since there’s no way to tell which outcome an ongoing project will have; however once a single live play finishes, the results will change. The drastic change can happen once most live plays come to an end since there’s a tremendous number of live plays recorded in the raw data.       

## Results
Overall, this data set can be used to make predicitons in terms of outcomes based on different variables for each kind of project subcategory. However since this data was also divided by country and their currencies, the definition of success has become more subjective in terms of the country as what's considered successful in one contry can be considered as a failure in another. Furthermore, the outcomes column is very binary so unless the analyst decides what's considered incredibly successful or an utter failure, there's no way in telling the degree of the outcomes. On the other hand, that can be a separate project for additional tables. Having boundaries dividing the degree of the outcome similar to deliverable 2.
